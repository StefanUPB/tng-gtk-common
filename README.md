# 5GTANGO API Gateway
This is the 5GTANGO API Gatekeeper Common micro-services for the Verification&amp;Validation and Service Platforms (built on top of [SONATA](https://github.com/sonata-nfv)) repository.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

This component has been developed in [ruby](https://ruby-lang.org), version `2.4.3`.

To get the code of this compoent you should execute the following `shell` commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-gtk-common.git
cd tng-gtk-common/
bundle install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

This component's configuration is done strictly through `ENV` variables.

The following `ENV` variables must be defined:

1. `CATALOGUE_URL`, which defines the `URL` to reach the [Catalogue](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-cat), e.g., `http://tng-cat:4011/catalogues/api/v2`;
1. `UNPACKAGER_URL`, which defines the `URL` to reach the [Packager](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package), e.g.,`http://tng-sdk-package:5099/api/v1/packages`

Optionally, you can also define the following `ENV` variables:

1. `INTERNAL_CALLBACK_URL`, which defines the `URL` for the [Packager](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package) component to notify this component about the finishing of the upload process, defaults to `http://tng-gtk-common:5000/packages/on-change`;
1. `EXTERNAL_CALLBACK_URL`, which defines the `URL` that this component should call, when  it is notified (by the [Packager](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package) component) that the package has been on-boarded, e.g.,`http://tng-vnv-lcm:6100/api/v1/packages/on-change`. See details on this component's [Design documentation wiki page](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-gtk-common/wiki/design-documentation);
1. `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`: defines the default number of 'records' that are returned on a single query, for pagination purposes. If absent, a value of `100` is assumed;
1. `DEFAULT_PAGE_NUMBER`: defines the default page to start showing the selected records (beginning at `0`), for pagination purposes. If absent, a value of `0` is assumed;

## Api Reference

This component's API is documented in a [Swagger 2.0 file](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-gtk-common/blob/master/doc/swagger.json). The current version does not support any form of authentication, since it is supposed to work with the [API Gateway](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-api-gtw/) component in fron of it.

The current version supports an `api_root` like `http://pre-int-ath.5gtango.eu:32003`. We are using the [`sinatra`](http://sinatrarb.com/) way of representing `URL` parameters, i.e., `:api_root`, `:package_uuid`, etc.

### Root
The root (`/`) API of this component can be accessed to return the API it implements (still a WiP).

```shell
$ curl :api_root/
```

### Pings
In order for the component to communicate it is alive, the following command can be issued:

```shell
$ curl :api_root/pings
```

An `HTTP` return code of `200` will indicate that the component is alive. In the current implementation, the answer will be a `Content-Type` of `application/json`, like in:

```json
{ "alive_since": "2018-05-14 10:53:41 UTC"}
```

### Packages
Packages constitute the unit for uploading information into the [Catalogue](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-cat).

You can get examples of packages [here (the good one)](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package/blob/master/misc/5gtango-ns-package-example.tgo) and [here (the malformed one)](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package/blob/master/misc/5gtango-ns-package-example-malformed.tgo).

#### On-boarding
On-boarding (i.e., uploading) a package is an **asynchronous** process that involves several components until the package is stored in the [Catalogue](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-cat):

1. the [API Gateway](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-api-gtw/) component;
1. this component, the [Gatekeeper Common](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-gtk-common/);
1. the [Packager](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package) component;
1. and the already mentioned [Catalogue](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-cat).

On-boarding a package can be done by the following command:

```shell
$ curl -X POST :api_root/packages -F "package=@./5gtango-ns-package-example.tgo"
```

 The `package` field is the only one that is mandatory, but there are a number of optional ones that you can check [here](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-package).
 
 Expected returned data is:

 * `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) if the package is accepted for processing, with a `JSON` object including the `package_processing_uuid` (see Querying the status, below);
 * `HTTP` code `400` (`Bad Request`), if the file is not found, has the wrong `MEDIA` type, etc. 
  
#### Querying

We may query the on-boarding process by issuing

```shell
$ curl :api_root/packages/status/:package_processing_uuid
```

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) if the package processing `UUID` is found, with the processing status in the body (`JSON` format);
* `HTTP` code `400` (`Bad Request`), if the `:package_processing_uuid` is mal-formed;
* `HTTP` code `404` (`Not Found`), if the package processing is not found.

Querying all existing packages can be done using the following command (default values for `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` and `DEFAULT_PAGE_NUMBER` mentioned above are used):

```shell
$ curl :api_root/packages
```

If different default values for the starting page number and the number of records per page are needed, these can be used as query parameters:

```shell
$ curl ":api_root/packages?page_size=20&page_number=2"
```

Note the `""` used around the command, in order for the `shell` used to consider the `&` as part of the command, instead of considering it a background process command.

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) with an array of package's metadata in the body (`JSON` format), or an empty array (`[]`) if none is found according to the parameters passed;

A specific package's metadata can be fetched using the following command:

```shell
$ curl :api_root/packages/:package_uuid
```

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) if the package is found, with the package's metadata in the body (`JSON` format);
* `HTTP` code `400` (`Bad Request`), if the `:package_uuid` is mal-formed;
* `HTTP` code `404` (`Not Found`), if the package is not found.

In case we want to download the package's file, we can use the following command:

```shell
$ curl :api_root/packages/:package_uuid/package-file
```

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) if the package is found, with the package's file in the body (binary format);
* `HTTP` code `400` (`Bad Request`), if the `:package_uuid` is mal-formed;
* `HTTP` code `404` (`Not Found`), if the package is not found.

#### Deleting

We may delete an on-boarded package by issuing the following command:

```shell
$ curl -X DELETE :api_root/packages/:package_uuid
```

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `204` (`No Content`) if the package is found and successfuly deleted (the body will be empty);
* `HTTP` code `400` (`Bad Request`), if the `:package_uuid` is mal-formed;
* `HTTP` code `404` (`Not Found`), if the package is not found.

### Services
Are are on-boarded within packages (see above), so one can not `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` them.

#### Querying

Querying all existing services can be done using the following command (default values for `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` and `DEFAULT_PAGE_NUMBER` mentioned above are used):

```shell
$ curl :api_root/services
```

If different default values for the starting page number and the number of records per page are needed, these can be used as query parameters:

```shell
$ curl ":api_root/services?page_size=20&page_number=2"
```

Note the `""` used around the command, in order for the `shell` used to consider the `&` as part of the command, instead of considering it a background process command.

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) with an array of services' metadata in the body (`JSON` format), or an empty array (`[]`) if none is found according to the parameters passed;

A specific service's metadata can be fetched using the following command:

```shell
$ curl :api_root/services/:service_uuid
```

Expected returned data is:

* `HTTP` code `200` (`Ok`) if the service is found, with the service's metadata in the body (`JSON` format);
* `HTTP` code `400` (`Bad Request`), if the `:service_uuid` is mal-formed;
* `HTTP` code `404` (`Not Found`), if the service is not found.
